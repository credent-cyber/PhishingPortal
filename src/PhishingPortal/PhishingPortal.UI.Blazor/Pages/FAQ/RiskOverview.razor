        <h1>Risk Score Calculation in Phishsims</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Phishsims is an advanced application designed to simulate phishing attacks and enhance cybersecurity awareness among organizations. One crucial metric within Phishsims is the Risk Score, which quantifies the overall risk level for a tenant based on the number of recipients who clicked on phishing emails, SMS messages, and WhatsApp messages throughout the calendar year.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Risk Score</h2>
        <p>The Risk Score in Phishsims is calculated as a total risk percentage, taking into account the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phished Email Clicks:</strong> The number of recipients who clicked on phishing links in emails.</li>
            <li><strong>Phished SMS Clicks:</strong> The number of recipients who interacted with phishing links in SMS messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Phished WhatsApp Clicks:</strong> The number of recipients who engaged with phishing messages on WhatsApp.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk Score Calculation</h2>
        <p>The Risk Score calculation formula is as follows:</p>
        <code>Risk Score = ((Phished Email Clicks + Phished SMS Clicks + Phished WhatsApp Clicks) / Total Recipients) * 100</code>
